## Where to place files

### Profiles

- Should be placed in `PM/profiles/groupX` where X is the profile author's group number.

### Test Cases

- Should be placed in the `QA/testing` folder. There, you will find subfolders related to the various functionalities that can be tested. If you can't find a folder related to the functionality you want to test, create one following the existing naming convention.
- The test file name should be `TestX.X_DESC` where X is an integer
  relative to the number of existing tests, starting at 1, and DESC is a very brief description of what is being tested.
