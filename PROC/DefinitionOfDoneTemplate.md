# What is a Definition of Done?

A Definition of Done is a list of things that must be done before an issue can be considered complete. It is a way to ensure that all issues are completed in a consistent way.

## Where and how do I write a Definition of Done?

The Definition of Done should be written in the issue description. It should be written in the form of a list, with no specific order (since they must all be completed), following the below template.

**The Definition of Done should only be found in the issue, and not in merge request, if the merge request was created correctly it will have a link back to the related issue which you can easily use to read the Definition of Done.**

It is recomend you use \` \` between file and folder names, to better set them apart from the rest of the text, like this `DEV/backend/main.py`

## Template

Definition of Done:

* File `YYY` should be found in folder `XXX`, complete and properly formatted
* Script `ZZZ` should produce no errors when run
* ...
* ...
* (The list has no max number of items, but it must have one minimum)
