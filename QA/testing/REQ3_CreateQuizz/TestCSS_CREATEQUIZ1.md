## Test Scenario

    Testing the CSS on the website's "Create Quizz" page.

## Actions to take

    Open the page in different screens and devices to test its reactivity to scale changes.

    Even margins that don't exceed the outer margins of the page, the absense of overlapped items. Good design practices overall.

    Some text boxes weren't pixel accurate on its width between themselves; the three buttons of the bottom of the page are overlapping in smaller screens; the main form of the page was distorting the page size on smaller screens due to a bad construction of the flexbox; 

# SUCCESS?
